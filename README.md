# Particula, a personal fork of Dracula for [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)

> A dark theme for [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)

I (@ilkka) forked this for my own use in order to tweak some things I wanted to change. I chose a different name so as not to cause anyone to think that I have anything to do with any Dracula-related development.

The excellent Dracula theme for tmux was written by Dane Williams and is used as the basis here under the terms of its MIT license.

I make no guarantees and almost certainly can't offer any kind of support :)
